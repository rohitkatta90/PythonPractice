# Functions, Indentations and While Loops

def function_name():
    #code
    #block
    #to be written for this function.
    print("Hello World")

function_name()

# In above example we also see how the code block is indented. So basically 
# we can either use tab / space(single space) to indent the code.

#While loop
number=1

while number <= 6:
    #code
    #block
    #to be written for this function.
    print("Hello World")
    number+=1
